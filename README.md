# 🚩 Challenge 2: 🏵 Token Vendor 🤖

![readme-2](./assets/readme-2.png)

> 🤖 Smart contracts are kind of like "always on" _vending machines_ that **anyone** can access. Let's make a decentralized, digital currency. Then, let's build an unstoppable vending machine that will buy and sell the currency. We'll learn about the "approve" pattern for ERC20s and how contract to contract interactions work.

> 🏵 Create `YourToken.sol` smart contract that inherits the **ERC20** token standard from OpenZeppelin. Set your token to `_mint()` **1000** (\* 10 \*\* 18) tokens to the `msg.sender`. Then create a `Vendor.sol` contract that sells your token using a payable `buyTokens()` function.

> 🎛 Edit the frontend that invites the user to input an amount of tokens they want to buy. We'll display a preview of the amount of ETH it will cost with a confirm button.

> 🔍 It will be important to verify your token's source code in the block explorer after you deploy. Supporters will want to be sure that it has a fixed supply and you can't just mint more.

> 🌟 The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase your ERC20 token, transfer it, and sell it back to the vendor. Deploy your contracts on your public chain of choice and then `yarn vercel` your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Install 📚

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Then download the challenge to your computer and install dependencies by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se-2-challenges.git challenge-2-token-vendor
cd challenge-2-token-vendor
git checkout challenge-2-token-vendor
yarn install
```

---

## Checkpoint 1: 🔭 Environment 📺

> in the same terminal, start your local network (a blockchain emulator in your computer):

```sh
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract (locally):

```sh
cd challenge-2-token-vendor
yarn deploy
```

> in a third terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```sh
cd challenge-2-token-vendor
yarn start
```

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

## Checkpoint 2: 🏵Your Token 💵

> 👩‍💻 Edit `YourToken.sol` to inherit the **ERC20** token standard from OpenZeppelin

> Mint **1000** (\* 10 \*\* 18) to your frontend address using the `constructor()`.

(Your frontend address is the address in the top right of http://localhost:3000)

> You can `yarn deploy --reset` to deploy your contract until you get it right.

### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Can you check the `balanceOf()` your frontend address in the **YourToken** of the `Debug Contracts` tab?
- [ ] Can you `transfer()` your token to another account and check _that_ account's `balanceOf`?

(Use an incognito window to create a new address and try sending to that new address. Use the `transfer()` function in the `Debug Contracts` tab.)

---

## Checkpoint 3: ⚖️ Vendor 🤖

> 👩‍💻 Edit the `Vendor.sol` contract with a **payable** `buyTokens()` function

Use a price variable named `tokensPerEth` set to **100**:

```solidity
uint256 public constant tokensPerEth = 100;
```

> 📝 The `buyTokens()` function in `Vendor.sol` should use `msg.value` and `tokensPerEth` to calculate an amount of tokens to `yourToken.transfer()` to `msg.sender`.

> 📟 Emit **event** `BuyTokens(address buyer, uint256 amountOfETH, uint256 amountOfTokens)` when tokens are purchased.

<!-- TODO: comment deploy_vendor -->

Edit `deploy/01_deploy_vendor.js` to deploy the `Vendor` (uncomment Vendor deploy lines).

### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] When you try to buy tokens from the vendor, you should get an error: **'ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance'**

⚠️ this is because the Vendor contract doesn't have any YourTokens yet!

⚔️ Side Quest: send tokens from your frontend address to the Vendor contract address and _then_ try to buy them.

> ✏️ We can't hard code the vendor address like we did above when deploying to the network because we won't know the vendor address at the time we create the token contract.

> ✏️ So instead, edit `YourToken.sol` to mint the tokens to the `msg.sender` (deployer) in the **constructor()**.

> ✏️ Then, edit `deploy/01_deploy_vendor.js` to transfer 1000 tokens to `vendor.address`.

```js
await yourToken.transfer(vendor.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
```

> You can `yarn deploy --reset` to deploy your contract until you get it right.

(You will use the `Token Vendor` UI tab and the frontend for most of your testing. Most of the UI is already built for you for this challenge.)

### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Does the `Vendor` address start with a `balanceOf` **1000** in `YourToken` on the `Debug Contracts` tab?
- [ ] Can you buy **10** tokens for **0.1** ETH?
- [ ] Can you transfer tokens to a different account?

> 📝 Edit `Vendor.sol` to inherit _Ownable_.

In `deploy/01_deploy_vendor.js` you will need to call `transferOwnership()` on the `Vendor` to make _your frontend address_ the `owner`:

```js
await vendor.transferOwnership("**YOUR FRONTEND ADDRESS**");
```

### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Is your frontend address the `owner` of the `Vendor`?

> 📝 Finally, add a `withdraw()` function in `Vendor.sol` that lets the owner withdraw ETH from the vendor.

### 🥅 Goals

- [ ] Can **only** the `owner` withdraw the ETH from the `Vendor`?

### ⚔️ Side Quests

- [ ] Can _anyone_ withdraw? Test _everything_!
- [ ] What if you minted **2000** and only sent **1000** to the `Vendor`?

## Checkpoint 4: 🤔 Vendor Buyback 🤯

👩‍🏫 The hardest part of this challenge is to build your `Vendor` to buy the tokens back.

🧐 The reason why this is hard is the `approve()` pattern in ERC20s.

😕 First, the user has to call `approve()` on the `YourToken` contract, approving the `Vendor` contract address to take some amount of tokens.

🤨 Then, the user makes a _second transaction_ to the `Vendor` contract to `sellTokens(uint256 amount)`.

🤓 The `Vendor` should call `yourToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), theAmount)` and if the user has approved the `Vendor` correctly, tokens should transfer to the `Vendor` and ETH should be sent to the user.

> 📝 Edit `Vendor.sol` and add a `sellTokens(uint256 amount)` function!

⚠️ You will need extra UI for calling `approve()` before calling `sellTokens(uint256 amount)`.

🔨 Use the `Debug Contracts` tab to call the approve and sellTokens() at first but then...

🔍 Look in the `packages/nextjs/pages/token-vendor.tsx` for the extra approve/sell UI to uncomment!

### 🥅 Goal

- [ ] Can you sell tokens back to the vendor?
- [ ] Do you receive the right amount of ETH for the tokens?

### ⚔️ Side Quests

- [ ] Should we disable the `owner` withdraw to keep liquidity in the `Vendor`?
- [ ] It would be a good idea to display Sell Token Events. Create the `event` and `emit` it in your `Vendor.sol` and look at `buyTokensEvents` in your `packages/nextjs/pages/token-vendor.tsx` for an example of how to update your frontend.

### ⚠️ Test it!

- Now is a good time to run `yarn test` to run the automated testing function. It will test that you hit the core checkpoints. You are looking for all green checkmarks and passing tests!

## Checkpoint 5: 💾 Deploy it! 🛰

📡 Edit the `defaultNetwork` in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js`, as well as `targetNetwork` in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`, to [your choice of public EVM networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/)

👩‍🚀 You will want to run `yarn account` to see if you have a **deployer address**.

🔐 If you don't have one, run `yarn generate` to create a mnemonic and save it locally for deploying.

🛰 Use a faucet like [web.getlaika.app/faucets](https://web.getlaika.app/faucets) to fund your **deployer address** (run `yarn account` again to view balances)

> 🚀 Run `yarn deploy` to deploy to your public network of choice (😅 wherever you can get ⛽️ gas)

🔬 Inspect the block explorer for the network you deployed to... make sure your contract is there.

---

## Checkpoint 6: 🚢 Ship it! 🚁

🪢 **Hint**: We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel (through the Vercel UI) so it gets automatically deployed when pushing to `main`.

👩‍💻 If you want to deploy directly from the CLI, run `yarn vercel` and follow the steps to deploy to Vercel. Once you log in (email, github, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

⚙ If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run `yarn vercel --prod`. If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

⚠️ **Make sure your `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` file has the values you need.**

---

## Checkpoint 7: 📜 Contract Verification

Update the `api-key` in `packages/hardhat/package.json`. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

> Now you are ready to run the `yarn verify --network your_network` command to verify your contracts on etherscan 🛰

👀 You may see an address for both YouToken and Vendor. You will want the Vendor address.

👉 This will be the URL you submit to 🏃‍♀️[SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com).
